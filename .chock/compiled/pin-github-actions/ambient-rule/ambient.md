on(commit|tool_use): block(content_regex) scan=added_lines allowlist_pragma=pragma:\s*allowlist\s+unpinned-action ...
Unpinned GitHub Action detected: a workflow references an action by a tag or branch (owner/repo at a movable ref) rather than a full 40-character commit SHA. Pin it to the SHA -- keep the version in a trailing comment for readability -- so a re-tagged or compromised release cannot change what runs. At commit, 'pragma: allowlist unpinned-action' on the same line marks a deliberate exception; the pragma is NOT honored at tool-use, where the scanned text is a live tool argument an appended token could neutralize.
