# Protect Agent Config

Guard against an agent hand-editing its own guardrails. Agent instruction files (AGENTS.md and the per-agent wrappers), permission files (.claude/settings.json, .mcp.json) and vendored enforcement (.chock/bin/, .chock/compiled/) define what the agent may do -- so a shell command that rewrites them is the agent modifying its own authority (MITRE ATLAS AML.T0081; the AIVSS self-modification factor). The guard refuses shell write-commands targeting those paths; reads pass, and regeneration through `chock sync` passes because the tool writes them itself rather than through shell editing. Best-effort and deliberately coarse: a compound command that both reads a protected file and writes elsewhere may be refused -- rewrite it in two steps. The 'chock: approved-config-change' escape marker is friction plus an audit trail, not authentication -- the agent can write it too; the check an agent cannot self-approve is the commit-time gate and CI.

This skill is advisory: the client reading it has no mechanism to enforce it, and this policy stays advisory even when compiled by `chock` -- it ships rule text, not a blocking hook. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
