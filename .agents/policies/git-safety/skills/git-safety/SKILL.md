# Git Safety Rule

trigger: force push, hard reset, destructive branch delete, hook bypass, direct main commits. avoid: rewriting remote history, discarding uncommitted work, skipping pre-commit checks. Install block-destructive-commands, block-no-verify and protect-main-branch for the enforced counterparts of these controls (protect-main-branch is a commit-time gate; the other two are pre-execution guards on hook-carrying clients, advisory elsewhere); this rule is the advisory layer over them plus atomic-commit and diff-size guidance no gate can decide.

```
see(block-destructive-commands): force_push|reset_hard|rm_-rf; see(block-no-verify): --no-verify|skip_hooks; see(protect-main-branch): direct_commit|push(main|master)
advisory: avoid(branch_-D) without_approval; prefer(feature_branch|atomic_commits); ask_if(diff > 500_lines)
```

This skill is advisory: the client reading it has no mechanism to enforce it, and this policy stays advisory even when compiled by `chock` -- it ships rule text, not a blocking hook. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
