# Scan Secrets

Blocks known credential patterns -- vendor key prefixes, private-key blocks, and key/token/password assignments -- at two enforcement points: at commit (the git hook, over staged changes) and at agent tool-use (the mcp-gateway / agent write guard, over a tool call's arguments), so a secret is caught as the agent writes it, before it ever reaches a commit. Matched by pattern, not by entropy analysis. Best-effort guard; not a replacement for a dedicated secret scanner.

Potential secret detected in this change. Remove credentials and rotate any exposed keys. At commit, add '# pragma: allowlist secret' on the same line only for documented test fixtures; the pragma is NOT honored at tool-use, where the scanned text is a live tool argument an appended token could neutralize.
```

This skill is advisory: the client reading it has no mechanism to enforce it. The same policy compiled by `chock` becomes a git hook that exits non-zero. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
